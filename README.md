# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# React State Management Lab

## About
- Welcome to Reactville, a constantly evolving virtual metropolis. Let’s build this digital town together, one component at a time.

- Reactville is on high alert! As bizarre rumors turn into chilling reality, the city council has called for immediate action to safeguard the town and its inhabitants - against a looming zombie apocalypse!

- Your mission is to strategically assemble a survival team, handpicking members from the city’s diverse population, each bringing their unique skills and quirks. As the city’s newly appointed Survival Strategist, you will manage your team’s skills, resources, and stats.

- In this lab, you’ll utilize React’s state management to add and remove team members, track essential resources, and monitor your team’s overall readiness. This isn’t just about surviving; it’s about making dynamic UI updates and understanding the inner workings of React state through a fun and engaging simulation.

## Exercise Overview
- Welcome to the React State Management Lab! In this lab, we’ll interact with state to better understand how to manage it in a React application. Your task is to assemble a team of characters to survive a zombie apocalypse. You will:

- Add characters to your team from a given list.
- Remove characters from your team.
- Display the team’s total cost, strength, and agility.

## Exercise
Follow these steps to complete the exercise. Keep all your code in the App.jsx file for this exercise.

1. Create a new state variable named team and set the initial state to an empty array [].

2. Create a new state variable named money and set the initial state to 100.

3. Create a new state variable named zombieFighters and set the initial state to the following array of objects: (Array of objects supplied by General Assembly).
